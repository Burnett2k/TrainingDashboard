function generateWeeksOfYear() {
  //goal: generate a list of sums of miles ridden separated by week.
  //Ex: week 1 (1/1 - 1/6) : 22
  //Ex: week 2 (1/7 - 1/13) : 39
  //2 options, we could loop through and create a list of each week and do a HTTP call
  //for each, or we could get the data for the whole year with a single http call
  // and then loop through all of it to summarize it.
  //the second option would require fewer network requests, so it is probably for the best
  //todo, HTTP call to get data for the entire year, Loop through the data and summarize each entry into what week it fits in.
